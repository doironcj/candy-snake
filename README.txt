Caleb Doiron and Andrew Hall Candy Python
Candy Python is a 2d snake survival game where the objective is
to get as large as possible by eating round pellets without colliding with
yourself or the red line bounds.  The snake is implemented with a buffer that saves positions of where the snake head has been for a select number of previous frames that is used to calculate the position and angle of the following segments of the snake. The snake head and segment's velocity is dependent on time instead of frame rate by calculating the difference in time between each frame.  There are three  buffers that the fragment shaders draw from.  The bound buffer is the coordinates that define the bounds of which the snake must not collide with.  This is drawn with a red line.  The second buffer is for the circular shape of the pellets drawn with a triangle fan.  The third buffer is for the polygones that make up the snake with the last two vectors representing the location of the eyes.  The anglular velocity of the turns are limited and the snake will follow the mouse or can be steered with the 'a' and 'd' keys.  For each frame the snake head position is tested for collision with the other objects in the scene.  If the snake head collides with itself or the bound lines the game ends.  If the snake collides with a pellet, the pellet disapears and the snake grows by two segments.  The pellets position are randomly generated and remain at a constant number.
